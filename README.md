# Next Auth starter

## Getting Started

1. Create a ```.env.local``` file.
2. Add the required secret keys.

3. Run the development server ðŸŽ‰ :

```bash

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.



The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
